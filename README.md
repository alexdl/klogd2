# klogd2

A new implementation of [klogd](https://github.com/leandrosilva/klogd) but in Java.

## What is klog?

Klog is nothing but a simple program to stream [Syslog](http://www.syslog.org) messages to a [Kafka](http://incubator.apache.org/kafka) server.

My motivation, as I said on [my recent blog post](http://leandrosilva.com.br/2012/09/06/klogd-what-about-route-syslog-messages-to-kafka), is that:

* Syslog is the standard bucket for logs on Unix-like operational systems;
* There are many legacy applications which use it and cannot be changed to use something else;
* I sought for a way to route Syslog messages to Kafka, but unfortunately I didnâ€™t find anything.

So I decided to try. And this is actually my second try, **klogd2**.

## Why a new version?

I'd want to try [Syslog4j](http://syslog4j.org) on the server side, because I know it's a rock solid stuff and all those cool kids are using it, e.g. [Graylog2](http://graylog2.org). So I decided to give myself a second time to fun and just wrote **klogd2**, which is also dumb simple like its older brother. But I'm planning to give it a chance to evolve.

## Getting Started

### 1) Make sure you have Kafka up and running properly

* [Kafka - Quick Start](http://incubator.apache.org/kafka/quickstart.html)

### 2) Build klogd2

    $ git clone git@github.com:leandrosilva/klogd2.git
    $ mvn compile assembly:single
    $ ls -la target/klogd2-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar

### 3) Configure Syslog messages routing

On Mac OS X, for example, you have to edit /etc/syslog.conf to include:

    *.info;authpriv,remoteauth,ftp,install,internal.none  @127.0.0.1:1514

### 4) Re-launch Syslog daemon to reflex the new configuration

On Mac OS X, for example, you have to:

    $ launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.syslogd.plist
    $ launchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.syslogd.plist

### 5) Start klogd

    $ ZOOKEEPER=127.0.0.1:2181 java -jar target/klogd2-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar 

If you don't provide ZOOKEEPER environment variable, klogd2 is going to assume **127.0.0.1:2181** as default.

### 6) Test it now!

At one terminal:

    $ KAFKA_HOME/bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --zookeeper 127.0.0.1:2181 --topic klog2

And at another:

    $ logger -p local0.info -t test.app "blah blah blah info info info"
